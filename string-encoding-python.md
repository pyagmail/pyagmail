In the string, you can add operators like 
\t anywhere you like. There’s also 
others: \n = linefeed (prints the stuff 
after this on the next line) \r = 
carriage return (basically also used for 
printing stuff on the next line) \’ = 
print a single quote ( ‘ ) in your text 
\” = print a double quote ( “ ) in your 
text
\\ = print a backslash ( \ ) in your text
